# Spicy SpotifyClient WebView

This hosts a website that is inspired by [Spicy Lyrcis (by Spikerko)](https://github.com/Spikerko/spicy-lyrics).
I basically made this to be able to use it at my TV. This prob won't get any updated. I know my css is kinda ass and I gotta optimize the js

To make it work fill the .env, access to the auth login `localhost/auth/login` (or your local ip address) and you are ready to go
